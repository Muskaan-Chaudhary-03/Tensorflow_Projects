1. Time Series Forecasting of Climate Data - 
 - This project demonstrates time series forecasting of temperature using the Jena climate dataset. We explored various modeling techniques, from simple baselines to more complex neural network architectures, leveraging TensorFlow and Keras.

 - Project Goals:

1. Load and preprocess the Jena climate dataset.
2. Implement different time series forecasting models.
3. Evaluate the performance of each model.
4. Compare the results and identify the most effective approach.

 - Key Technologies and Libraries:

1. TensorFlow: Core deep learning library.
2. Keras: High-level API for building and training neural networks.
3. NumPy: Numerical computing library.
4. Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
5. Matplotlib: Data visualization library.
3. Seaborn: Statistical data visualization library.
